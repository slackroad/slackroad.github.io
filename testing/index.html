		<h1> LYRICS: </h1>
		And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed,
		Just to get it all out, what's in my head.
		~yeayeayea
		And I, I am feeling
		a little peculiar.
		And so I wake in the morning and I stepped outside.
		And I take a deep breath and I get real high.
		And I scream from the top of my lungs,
		What's goin' on!
		And I say hey, ay, ay, yay hey,
		Hey, ay, ay
		I said hey!
		What's goin' on?
		And I say hey, ay, ay, yay hey.
		Hey, ay, ay
		I said hey!
		What's goin' on?
		And he tries!
		Oh my God, do I try
		I try all the time,
		in this institution.
		And, he prays!
		Oh my God, do I pray?
		I pray every single day!
		~Nyah!
		FOR REVOLUTION!
		And I say hey, ay, ay, yay hey,
		Hey, ay, ay
		I said hey!
		What's goin' on?
		And I say hey, ay, ay, yay hey,
		Hey, ay, ay
		I said - hey,
		(Don't cry out loud,
		Just keep it inside.
		Learn how to hide your feelings)
		(Hey, hey, hey, hey hey)
		(Hey, hey)
		HEY EY EY!
		I say HEY!
		What's goin' on!
		YEAH!!!!
